# My 42 Curriculum Journey

This repository documents my self-guided progress through School 42's curriculum, starting with the "00_global" project. I'm undertaking this journey independently, outside the official school environment.

## Background

I recently completed 42's C programming piscine on my own. For a more detailed and fun look at my piscine experience, check out my [42_baignoire repository](https://github.com/joaok-dev/42_baignoire).

Now, I'm continuing with the curriculum, beginning with the Global project - the standard first step for post-piscine students.

## Goals

- Complete the Global project
- Follow 42's self-directed learning approach
- Document my progress and learnings
- Prepare for future projects in the 42 curriculum

## Structure

Each project will have its own directory, containing:
- Source code
- Project instructions (if available)
- Personal notes and reflections

## Disclaimer

This is a personal educational project. I am not officially enrolled at School 42, and this repository is not affiliated with the school.
